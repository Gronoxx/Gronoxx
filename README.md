## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find all the projects Iâ€™ve developed during my Information Systems degree at UFMG. This repository reflects the academic activities, including challenges, projects, and experiments Iâ€™ve worked on throughout the course.

Feel free to explore the projects, suggest improvements, or even collaborate. Iâ€™m always open to discussions and contributions!
